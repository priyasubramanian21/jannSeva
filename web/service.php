                    Obesity or over weight is a metabolic disorder involving an excessive amount of body fat. It's a
                    medical problem that increases the risk of other diseases and health problems, such as heart
                    disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and certain cancers.
                    It may be because of genetics or modern life style

                </p>

                <p>

                    anaerobic patterns of physical exercise that combines rhythmic exercise with stretching, strength

                <p>
                    A sport is an aspect of human life that is of paramount importance. Playing sports teaches lessons
                    in life such as teamwork, accountability, responsibility, self-confidence and also a competitive
                    behavior.

                <p>
                    Nothing feels better than knowing you can take care of yourself mentally, financially, and
                    physically. However, for a lot of people, the physical part is just exercise. Being able to protect
                    yourself in all situations is a confidence booster as much as it is a reassurance. A reassurance
                    that can only be gained through any form of self-defense classes. Today, when people think about
                    self-defense classes, they tend to think about women and children. However, self-defense classes are
                    for everyone. We train our students to tackle such situation through self-defense techniques.
